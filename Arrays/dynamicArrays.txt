DYNAMIC ARRAYS
Dynamic Arrays are a much more common alternative to static arrays. They are useful because they can grow as elements are added. In JavaScript and Python, these are the default arrays.

Unlike static arrays, with dynamic arrays we donâ€™t have to specify a size upon initialization.


Insert n in the last position of the array
pushback(n) {
    // 1. Check if array is at full capacity
    if (this.length == this.capacity) {
        // 2. Double the array size if needed
        this.resize();
    }
    // 3. Insert element at the next empty position
    this.arr[this.length] = n;
    // 4. Update the count of elements
    this.length++;
}



RESIZING DYNAMIC ARRAYS
resize() {
    // 1. Double the capacity
    this.capacity = 2 * this.capacity;

    // 2. Create new array with doubled size
    const newArr = new Array(this.capacity);

    // 3. Copy all existing elements to the new array
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
        newArr[i] = this.arr[i];
    }

    // 4. Replace old array with new one
    this.arr = newArr;
}
