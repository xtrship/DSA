An array is an ordered collection of contiguous elements, for example [1,3,5] even though computers only understand data in terms of bits such as ones and zeroes.

A byte is 8 bits and abit is a positon that can store a digit and the restriction is that it must be a zero or one. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is 8 empty bits which make a BYTE.

RAM = Random Access Memory.

The integer 1 in the arrayn is represented asd 4 bytes which are 32 bits.
Values are stored at a distinct location which is known as an address. Each value in the array takes 4 bytes therefore the address increments by 4 for easch value in the array.

Characters are also stored contiguosly. The difference is characters take only one byte compared to digits.

Key notes:
- A GB is 10^9 bytes
- A byte of RAM is exactly 8 bits.


Each value in the [1,3,5] has a binary representation, the first task is to write a program that converts integers in an arrrau into its binary rperesentation.
